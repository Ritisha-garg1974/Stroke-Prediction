# Stroke Prediction
## End to End project using 5 ML Algorithms

The aim of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, hypertension, various heart diseases, smoking status, ever-married, residential type, work type,  BMI, and average glucose level.


## Objective 

Stroke is becoming an important cause of premature death and disability in low-income and middle-income countries like India, largely driven by demographic changes, work load, eating habits, residential area. This projects aims to capture important features which are the main reasons for strokes. The projects also teaches us to give a quick check on our daily eating habits, teaches us that we should practice yoga to keep our mind calm.
## Steps of the project

Part 1: Importing the libraries and loading the dataset

Part 2: Data Preparation -  Handling Missing values, Feature selection, Outlier removal, Encoding, Partitioning, and Standardisation.

Part 3: Model Training - Using 5 machine learning algorithms namely Decision tree, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Random forest regressor, and K-nearest neighbors.

Part 4: Model Evaluation -  For each algorithms accuracy score is calculated.

Part 5: Deployment using Flask
